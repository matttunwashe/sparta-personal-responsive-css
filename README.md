### Personal responsive website

**Brief**
--------
I'm currently working on my portfolio which is a responsive css website. It is a mobile-first design that enables users to view it both on mobile phones and laptops.

**Difficulty**
-----
* It was confusing to implement the bootstrap navigation bar; but after a couple of code trial and error, I understood it.
* It was hard for me to link buttons which are in the navigation bar to the exact point of reference on the same page. After various attempts, I managed to fix it.

**what I'm pleased with**
----
* I was able to style the whole page without making use of the bootsrap grid system. This was the long way to get this task done but it was worth at the end because it exposed me to various css functions.
*  With minimal code, I was able to put my picture into the right spot.
